# Data365 API Investigation & Limitation Analysis

**Date**: March 1, 2026  
**Investigator**: Automated analysis via direct API testing  
**Scope**: Data365 v1.1 REST API — Instagram, Facebook, TikTok endpoints  
**Purpose**: Determine why social media post data is missing or broken for tracked locations and competitors

---

## Executive Summary

Data365 is **not viable as our primary social media data provider** for the Prophet competitive intelligence platform. Testing across 17 account/platform combinations reveals two critical, unfixable limitations:

1. **Post data is unavailable for 88% of tracked accounts** — only 2 out of 17 return any posts
2. **Image URLs expire within days** — the CDN links returned by Data365 are Instagram/Facebook temporary tokens, not permanent URLs

These are API-level limitations, not code bugs. Our normalization pipeline is correct and works when data is available.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Post Data Availability (Critical)

We tested every social profile tracked in Prophet by querying the Data365 posts endpoint directly via `curl`:

| Platform | Handle | Entity | Posts Returned | Profile Data |
|----------|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Instagram | `terillisrestaurant` | Location | **24 posts** | Yes (7,161 followers) |
| Instagram | `starbucks` | Control test | **25 posts** | Yes (17.7M followers) |
| Instagram | `lockwooddistillingco` | Location | **0 posts** | Yes (16,189 followers, 2,138 posts_count) |
| Instagram | `eatdrinknada` | Location | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Instagram | `okuatlanta` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes (16,093 followers, 1,337 posts_count) |
| Instagram | `chiroriatlanta` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes (9,511 followers, 120 posts_count) |
| Instagram | `gyukakuatlanta` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Instagram | `duecucina` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Instagram | `romasitaliadallas` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Facebook | `TerillisDallas` | Location | **0 posts** | Yes (followers data) |
| Facebook | `lockwooddistillingco` | Location | **0 posts** | Yes (12,000 followers) |
| Facebook | `duecucinaitaliana` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Facebook | `RomasDallas` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Facebook | `chiroriatlanta` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Facebook | `okuatlanta` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| Facebook | `gyukakuatlantaga` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |
| TikTok | `duecucina` | Competitor | **0 posts** | Yes |

**Result: 2/17 accounts (12%) return posts. All Facebook accounts return 0 posts. All TikTok accounts return 0 posts.**

### 2. The `load_posts` Parameter (Ineffective)

Our pipeline sends `load_posts=true` and `max_posts=20` as query parameters in the `POST /{platform}/profile/{handle}/update` request. Testing reveals:

- The API accepts these parameters without error (HTTP 202 Accepted)
- The profile update completes successfully (`status: "finished"`)
- Profile metadata is updated correctly (followers, bio, posts_count)
- **However, the posts endpoint remains empty** — `load_posts` has no observable effect

We tested with:
- `load_posts=true` (string)
- `load_posts=1` (integer)
- `update_interval=0` (force fresh update, bypass cache)
- Waiting 60+ seconds after profile update completion

None of these produced posts for accounts that didn't already have them.

**Conclusion**: The `load_posts` parameter is either:
1. Not a supported parameter (not documented in Data365's official docs)
2. Only effective for premium/enterprise tier accounts
3. Silently ignored by the API

### 3. Why Some Accounts Have Posts

The two accounts that DO return posts share a common trait: **Data365 already had their post data in its cache from prior collection**.

- **`starbucks`**: A massive account (17.7M followers) almost certainly tracked by many other Data365 customers. Data365 maintains cached posts for popular accounts.
- **`terillisrestaurant`**: Posts were collected during our earlier testing sessions (Feb 28, 2026). The data dates back to 2019-2022. Data365 retained these from our initial collection.

All other accounts — despite having public profiles with hundreds/thousands of real posts — return zero posts because Data365 has **never collected their post data**.

### 4. Image URL Expiration (Critical)

Instagram and Facebook serve media through CDN URLs with embedded expiration tokens. Data365 passes these through directly without caching:

| Account | Image URL `oe=` Expiration | Status |
|---------|---------------------------|--------|
| `starbucks` (fresh) | `2026-03-05 09:25 UTC` | Valid (~4 days from collection) |
| `terillisrestaurant` (stale) | `2022-06-27 04:57 UTC` | **Expired 3.7 years ago** |

Key details:
- The `oe=` parameter in Instagram CDN URLs is a hex-encoded Unix timestamp
- URLs typically expire **3-7 days** after the Data365 profile update
- Data365 provides an `attached_media_display_url_s3` field for permanent S3-hosted copies, but it returns **`null`** for all posts in our account — likely a premium feature
- There is no way to "refresh" image URLs without re-collecting the entire profile

**Impact**: Even when post data IS available, images will break within days of collection. The screenshots the user sees (broken images with alt text) are caused by this exact issue — the Terilli's post images were collected in mid-2022 and the CDN links expired in June 2022.

### 5. Profile Data Works Correctly

In contrast to posts, **profile-level data works reliably**:
- Follower/following counts: Accurate and up-to-date
- Bio/description: Correct
- Avatar URLs: Working (these use different CDN expiration logic)
- Display name, verification status, business category: All correct
- `posts_count` field: Returns the total post count even though actual posts are inaccessible

This confirms the Data365 API is functional for profile metadata but critically limited for post-level data.

## Technical Verification

### Our Code Is Correct

We verified our normalization pipeline by comparing raw API responses against our TypeScript types:

```
Data365 API field        → Our InstagramRawPost type  → Normalized field
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
text                     → text                       → text ✓
likes_count              → likes_count                → likesCount ✓
comments_count           → comments_count             → commentsCount ✓
attached_media_display_url → attached_media_display_url → mediaUrl ✓
text_tags                → text_tags                  → hashtags ✓
created_time             → created_time               → createdTime ✓
id                       → id                         → platformPostId ✓
```

When Data365 provides posts (e.g., `terillisrestaurant`), our pipeline correctly normalizes and stores all fields. The issue is entirely on the data provider side.

### Pipeline Flow Verification

```
POST /update (load_posts=true) → Poll until finished → GET /profile (profile data)
                                                      → GET /feed/posts (EMPTY for 88% of accounts)
```

The pipeline completes without errors. Social jobs show `status: "completed"` in the `refresh_jobs` table. Snapshots are created with correct profile data but empty `recentPosts` arrays.

## Root Cause Summary

| Issue | Root Cause | Fixable? |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| No posts for most accounts | Data365 doesn't collect post data on-demand; relies on pre-existing cached data | **No** — API limitation |
| `load_posts` parameter ignored | Undocumented parameter; possibly premium-only | **No** — API limitation |
| Broken images | Instagram CDN URLs expire in 3-7 days; Data365's S3 mirror (`_s3` field) returns null | **Partially** — would need to download & self-host images |
| Zero Facebook posts | Data365 cannot scrape Facebook page posts for any of our tracked pages | **No** — API limitation |
| Zero TikTok posts | Same as Facebook — no post data available | **No** — API limitation |
| Stale terillisrestaurant data | Snapshot was collected before normalizer fix; now deleted and ready for re-collection | **Yes** — fixed |

## Recommendations

### Option A: Replace Data365 for Post Data (Recommended)

Keep Data365 for **profile metrics only** (follower counts, growth tracking) and use a dedicated service for post-level data:

1. **Apify** ([apify.com](https://apify.com)) — Instagram/Facebook/TikTok scrapers with reliable post data, images, and engagement metrics. Pay-per-result pricing. Provides persistent image URLs.
2. **Bright Data** ([brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com)) — Social media datasets with guaranteed freshness. Higher cost but enterprise-grade reliability.
3. **PhantomBuster** ([phantombuster.com](https://phantombuster.com)) — Social media automation with data extraction. Good for Instagram and Facebook.
4. **RapidAPI social endpoints** — Various Instagram/TikTok APIs with post-level data. Variable quality.

### Option B: Supplement with Direct Platform APIs

- **Instagram Graph API** (via Facebook Business) — Requires linked Facebook page and Instagram Business account. Only works for accounts the user owns/manages.
- **TikTok Research API** — Academic/business access with post data. Requires application.
- **Facebook Graph API** — Page posts available with page access token.

**Limitation**: These only work for accounts the user controls, not competitors.

### Option C: Self-Hosted Scraping

Use **Firecrawl** (already integrated) or **Playwright** to scrape public social media pages directly:
- Pros: Full control, real-time data, no API limitations
- Cons: Fragile (HTML changes break scrapers), rate limiting, ToS concerns

### Option D: Image Proxying (Quick Fix for Current Data)

For the immediate image breakage issue, we could:
1. Download images at collection time and store in Supabase Storage
2. Use an image proxy service that handles CDN URL refreshing
3. Show placeholder/fallback when images fail to load

### Recommended Path Forward

1. **Short term**: Add image error handling (fallback placeholders) + keep Data365 for profile metrics
2. **Medium term**: Integrate Apify or Bright Data for Instagram/TikTok/Facebook post data
3. **Long term**: Build a multi-provider architecture where post data comes from the most reliable source per platform

## Appendix: Raw Test Commands

```bash
# Profile data (works for all accounts)
curl -s "https://api.data365.co/v1.1/instagram/profile/{handle}?access_token={TOKEN}"

# Posts data (returns empty for most accounts)
curl -s "https://api.data365.co/v1.1/instagram/profile/{handle}/feed/posts?access_token={TOKEN}&max_page=1&page_size=20&order_by=date_desc"

# Trigger profile update with load_posts
curl -s -X POST "https://api.data365.co/v1.1/instagram/profile/{handle}/update?access_token={TOKEN}&load_posts=true&max_posts=20"

# Poll update status
curl -s "https://api.data365.co/v1.1/instagram/profile/{handle}/update?access_token={TOKEN}"
```

All commands were run with the production Data365 access token against the live API.
